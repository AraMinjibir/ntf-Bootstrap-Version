# ntf-Bootstrap-Version
# Project Description

In my quest to enhance my skills in responsive design, I decided to transform all my previous exercises into responsive designs, and this project is one of them.

The project includes a container named 'container-fluid,' which houses a grid container (row). Within this row, there is a single column. The column contains a card with images and text.

The font-family used is 'Outfit,' with a font size of 16px and font weights of 600, 400, and 300.

Some CSS attributes provided were not documented in Bootstrap. However, I utilized custom CSS to tailor them, and I employed certain Bootstrap features to control their behavior.

The expected outcome of the project can be found in the images folder.
